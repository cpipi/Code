      "i'm going to tell you a little bit about so post plus and most such talk i labour what the language is or how you use it this i'm trying to make a talk about how the language became to be what it is and is the see ablution from the early days of the bar three years from now and if i get a bit boring you can look at the pictures essentially all other pictures has something or other to do with superlative what do you think those turbines and programmed it and so that's it i am going to go libitina what as she possesses rolling the world what is what did i intended to be and what what what what is it now then i'm going to give a code of sample i really feel like a toad if i talk about programming and so divilment without showing coat i mean if you see a presentation about soft were elopement without cold i start to worry and then i'm going to talk about the recent evolution a lot of the talk has to do with what has happened in the last minute plus three years omelike that and my my thesis here is said there the very of prodigue is a quality of the applications what matters is what interesting things should do with it that is my mither of success not the how clever code i can see the intercom purforate this this is this is very much a practical exercise trying to to do something good in the world of course on control what people are using the language for some of the things you might not like but these other things i i consider a somewhat cool and i am not ponto into into langworthy not to be ruled about she cast pacifications so that said i you are not going to drag me into tolerates lots of interesting stuff here and so what i've been doing since my ph d days is sir to sissy stems and i'm so very interested in that doing it there is my one of my notions of a distributer system it's a distribute or system with wiggles and a lot of the prepostors up in places where you would never think about it and you were never see it if it works right it's a if you notice it supererogation on the point he is a nobody understands all of this nobody can understand it any depth all the applications that i was just figuring through a few pictures of miladi however the purposely exercise as far as i am concerned is to help people that appealing these things therefore if i build something that can only do what i can imagine i failed you have to do things i couldn't possibly imagine the group here has more ideas more needs than i could imagine and and that's part of the point so what italy matters the answer is not of things and the one theme here is that when we need to be litanei we need a language to a border or those to avoid so that it can handle new things the world is changing we changing that the challenges a changing and the language has to do it on the other hand you are seen languages that are really cold for that five years then there desire i get a promotion and die we would can't have that not for things at last for they ate a lot of the things on my pictures had the interesting property that they will ripen ten fifteen twenty years ago they are still being developed and changed you have to handle that span that's really high and obviously there or not in this kind of stuff to talk for days i have one heart i'd like to point out that the best being the best of one or two things is not sufficient me that's how i can write a really nice paper a mutant eepers i agreed a lot of them i have ridden a fair number of them but that is not the end product for two building a too is good enough if it is good enough for everything that somebody using it neat now you have to remember that no language is good enough for everybody and for everything but if you should use a cord it should be good enough at what at every aspect of what you're doing not just being the best of something and so let her go back and see what the world was like when when i started for papias mostly black and white it seemed that is a large computer it a perependev he yet allows a programme to have twentieth cof memory and it runs with old almost a megaton onward and this is there is ricketson working on it noise highly advanced i sister ah that was what the world looked like and there's lots of things seated in her function prototypes i hadn't invented them yet so i didn't have to say of the art in a static development yes lots of languages has functioned argument shaking a conversion but satiates all kinds o stop keepers were cooled into one hundred they didn't even have one that utilitate one of the point is at every body knew that object oriented was useless this is almost right because ninety nine per cent of peboan what occupant was never heard of it and of the one set new about it knew it wouldn't work it was tusitala purpose and the difficult ordinary mortals to use and i tried to convince somebody is if you want to virtual function you haven't done your analysis right me you want to carnacion you know i don't know what i wanted is a lisette was some obstacle to all come i point this out because in retrospect the lot of this looks trivial and easy so i probably won't convince you but it wasn't easy so here's oropastes as it relates to see peplus year it's a line of the bellomont where the purse of the exercise is to extract every single bite every single since out of the machine started with a simple machine cold go through peace planchenoit we have the the great improvement in programming the greatest in history which is basing somebody figaro that we should have human oriented things at picton specific concepts in a language so that we can talk about our programmes in the capillaries when we design things as opposed to loathe machine or the time that's for time and as soon as people had fortune robustness ever wander one they got cold boar everybody wanted one and very surely had about twenty of them and had the native that everybody could write in a specific domain much more pleasant than a temblador they couldn't talk to a jo the terminology was different the days are formed with different they could even exchange data so simile a came about together with ober dorian de programming as an attempt to say why put application specific concept into a program lane to ch why don't we instead give the program as the ability to design their own abstractions they all concepts on types and that's how we got up tortora ing and if you write it any programming language that course of type a class you can say thanks true or a cristino go there because that's where i came from a computer science was very new he was trained as a man musician in new or classes was he did not know what types were and so i needed something that could handle a traction and could handle hardware and that's why i bilious by allowing abstraction maenius there and lots of interesting things happened after that now she passed us is as far as i am concerned there so that i don't have to choose between elegance mischancy when i do things well they are elegant and efficient that is when you express things really well really clear really logically consistent hopefully the optimist and generates really good cook that's the idea and sometimes we get it to get it all the time and we can do even better but let's see idea and we do that by defining life wait abstractions not fit heavy complicated abstractions ethereality want a point than the matricule no boy gets really quite difficult and that's where the challenges are and so she postponed as language for resource constrained applications there's lots of applications it is on those pictures lothario on well starting in the eight years and still to day where you could do much better i had twice as much memory ought twice as many processes or traces fast processes but you don't those servants course sixty million us dollars and if you are cold is half the speed of what it should be you need to buy two and you have to power them up and run them and maintain them in all of this kind of stuff so this is where a resource contained manners and that means as he plutus's deep deep in our usurpature because that's where you have the constraints of performance and reliability and holland she amended abstraction those of those two lines on the history child and again no language is perfect by everything in everybody and i don't know how many of you have have read the dragon book it's a case takes book in a about how to be compiled it shows the night at with the weapons of computer science defeating the dragon of complexity sometimes the dragon went we haven't reached perfection we can do much better so he is one i mean by a direct map to hardware the premature operations met to instructions on the set if you add to or introduce its the air into your hair to operation seems simple but along with one languages don't do it memory is just as a sequence of objects you often bites and you have addresses the concho which bit which optical king about that's it it's a brilliantly simple abstraction that the distraction made you can compose object the simperton like you take some of the same type and put them next to a job you get an array if you put things that are different hopes together you can get struck some classes and things like that and if you need to refer to something that elsewhere you have points that are simply simply machine addresses and sweeteners so pacing this is the real secret of sea and splashes it's really simple it's real easy to map to the hardware its compact its sufficient okay so down by the hard warlike is actually rather on pleasant because there's not much help and you don't really want to work with bitonto and such all the time and and and rollins and such so we want to abstract from it and so the basic idea of cupolas is a should allow you to be your own type and they should follow what i call the serio had principal what you don't go you don't pay pay for and what you do you you shouldn't be able to hand coat any better so if i am providing a notion of a truss you should not be able to hand codeine and struck such a tapering better and there's lots of examples here and finally sometimes redon actin to generate any cold and of compute the answer compile that's getting more and more popular so here it abstractions or the way down we start with our high level of tractions la build on lower level of strikin a build on the language which builds on the on the basic machine made and the machine model is also an abstraction of course there is much more that to a machine agatha the last cases and all kinds of our stuff like that this is an attraction this is denis's abstraction it's a good one i borrowed it and you go down to get to the heart were and what are you find no and interlachen does not execute a design structions directly it translated six instructions into a much nicer instruction set which it can obtuse execute better its attractions or widow institutes and you always have tobacko concrete examples there are people who think abstraction is another word for blot this is not the case you do it right you after i found concrete examples maintaining performance or the way off and you have to keep simple things simple because sometimes when you abstract things so he can do everything you can do nothing simply you want simple things to be simple these sort design principles are a work with a will and then there is question of man how did she plutus get to be cause plutus well it was an an allange he of course splenetically stood for cambridge program language that they ran out of money and the combined with imperial and was combined programming language and then was to congregated the cold builded nettie except they built a simple thing larich a phisician then it became be for short while and sea was denis's work that made efficient and beeroo hanway used and then she repasses a sidecar for about three years till hours told i couldn't call it separes because some people were calling see old sea annotator to denis i was not rude to denyeth him most days and beeves up we've never had a harsh word between us and there i tried to call it see she put so eighty four that never flew because the pedro the sea committed came and said well please don't do that gun it would really be embarrassing if a super side of see eighty five the standard sea would urbanity confinement was not so i had a competition or for calling it a something and a secular one and she said we knew proposed matter is cambridge all combined because everybody knew it took for christopher she that you stole i should point out that mary hill where i worked and we designed she pluffles right oother and let's congregator the separator well we had a competition a commers ago for what is your favourite she pustular and when roger or suggested the incur we all backed off that they can't be beat that's it that's where all the magic happens so one of the things that distinguishes he proposes is this model you you you may object we constructors and if you don't say anything else the escopeta and no school the destructor fires doing the magic cleaning up the messes closing up what should be closed on that that's surely he and i looked at my notes and it's a real course he pressed buskin the first two weeks of the bellmen back in a seventeen nine together with classes member unconsenting function decorations now a good stuff like that and being that is the key to a lot of what we are doing to day the stand alive uses it there are handling is depending credit is it hesitatin type a class it has two parts the popping in surface and the implementation so basin you this is one level of abstraction and that is a low level obstruction on which it is built and you work that up and down all the way as i have given it there's an element type and it tapioca construct this one by a list of initials of its elements type and here is the can of function that's where you release the memory you do so here we can use it i take a back coldwatham window constance and i take a victor of strings with some well known language to sign this i would like to point out i been using the light for years i did not put it into greece you this this is this is this is the way i do it and be basically we get to the curly here it goes on tramp everything that was created by the objects in that scope and that's a very powerful attraction they can so we use it for just about everything in the superposed of library the victors mists mathusalem strings and such they are are working on this model you acquire resources when you were when you when you create a variable and you regain at the end of the scope and this is this a thing that we acquire an not just memory there things like threatenin bulbosus for four streams locks and when we have smart pointers we do use counts and things like that this means that if you can't just fire alegaiter and collect all the memory not only would that give you long o resource retention because instead of creaming up the mess you leave the mist for somebody else to clean up later therefore the resources held on for much longer so much garments shows an average twice anyway and this work securely to if i have something like a gadget which holds a five hand diana lock and such and a victor of records contain or worse it were folly okay so let's take a more concrete example semi concrete there's a gate i created with some initials and i get a pointer out there this is the way we rotoli the in the eight is this is the way they wrote cold and sellin the sixties is nothing new here and were seeing too much of it but anyway this is what we do we don't accent this one does its constructors all the resources necessary for working well and knowledge redtown here and if this easter withdraws something if is that we return and when we have finished we delete lubec again i mean we acquire using a new witnesses as you see sometimes we don't get there so he was spring me one age collection because this is easy to forget its easy to get wrong articulation get there a return with to get there so his leaks and so it comes said you you don't really want new sitting out there naked and you don't want the leach being there naked because they carlavero strongly with bars she want to get rid of it that easy way of getting rid of it is that instead of having the cadet made by new we have a function in sandebar can make shift it makes her object of that type with that initial and return as she appoint a ship point as a counter point when the last ship pointed to an object is destroyed the use count has gone to syro it destroys a object it one and therefore we will have detected destroyed there there and there and the problem goes away except that now we have she appoints and we have used constant this violates a sera principle because we have to excess that use corrupted and reset in a misty threaded environment that is at a costly operation because labe synchronized and anyway i don't want to crave garage i can't see any garbage here that needs to be collected i can't see anything lorrequer i used to i have one point and i goes away why do i have to count sire on sir no we can do better actually the same to code is there you just take a local variable come to it you use it and the destruction be called there they are there because when you go out of scope to the structures court problem sort and the cold shower and so don't use now in general code because they belong in resource management code so if i see it let in your cold i assume there's a bug that you have two fumana if i see a new i know you need a belesme where so i shall as a banaotovich simple and if you really need points amidst be counted you don't know a lot on aship yet she appoints there is italy quite useful but of people all oussoor problem that is quite awfully make a big object so lots of data and then we wanted to get out of the function that did it get back to the weariest ed it and this is what people used pointsman they use free store or to own a steamer or heap they out to that alencon of back one have all the problems back again so we need to avoid thing so here i make the cadet and here returned and conventionally when we can have something that a copy so basely here i call if and here we caeteris now must point out that only a computer science is could have thought of that so to get this one from here should there you make a copy or were they and you destroy your original no baby is about four to six months or wild now here it is now your there now to beg again they can figure it out so we just have to make sure that that's what we do so here is jean it's a gadget and if it's a big thing like a matrix abettance tion of stuff out the stuff booboorowie the free store and loss a handle to it so all we need to do is to prophane introduce in the hand of is that the small if this is a material it three words and then we cut the connection to the first gate so the destructor doesn't er get to throw away the good stuff and problem so and so the course of getting say amagay the stuff out if you do it like this is why childer memory as i had meant and now you know roger have to worry about pointers memory management of shippons nor this doth this complete spectral of the life sideless have been doing this since the ninth is but its only became systematic and guaranteed that it could be done in the sipahis is the handiwork of guy caught howard hand that found out how to show were formalized that so that easily done now or so i'd like one talk about evolution to point out that i have never claimed she plus plus is an object orient language it never was just an object orient the language is never meant to be just enough citrine language i don't think everything should be in past higher is any of the stuff so she prefers not affectation did for any definition of objector for stars we need to deal with this diagraming charter when hardware tends to be massy so we have to do things that the tube like objects in a real way they actually real world objects and you you have to oecumenical we want marsmen for some things so a b a b comes be mean they had the same value and what evocation of the one doesn't fix the all this is what we do for insides for complex numbers for points for victors et cetera so that that's always been in spirally think this a nice notation this is a nicest notation and such and i don't want to have two versions of a sniff i add a rating point number two inside i don't want in the insides to have something as hate fuligine numbers in the floating point number the class takes one thing as takin tides i i want the the old fashion by three under years old notations that it for other more generic programming was always part of of the separate plan so i left doesn't fit with the octette days they control rose protasis by an iota committee and the way that happened was that representatives from h p and sun turned over my office and explained to me that i wanted to extend the diseases willis answered went ready it's not finished it to a project and they so twisted my arm a a and in the end a cities the argument was that you could not have a language our major language poorly controlled by a sin single company every body believed that those days it had been proven on true people using java and see sharp even though they are owned and operated by an individual a company that might be your competitive anyway at the time nobody believes that could be done they have not thought about the advertising campaign acadian the allayment was for a blunt well we will not trust you so there employ or eighteen the we will of course trust you but you could get ronneby a bus in the foot and so i agreed to send alicia many kinds of standardisation at the eyes ostentation here is sort of the gold standard of ostentation is thorough it open and the hasrat we get lit long terms ability which is a feature an important feature to many of the major uses its mendaeans really hard to sororities sold favors my company ravensdene designed by a comedy is horrible stagnation could happen if people decided not to do major things because they couldn't agree on which major things to do there's divergent or action of the sign if you get sufficient number of people aconitin and they have a temple of all elaborating any individual feature you can see that in seclusion places i'm not going to go into detail i'm just going to show you a picture of the committee so this is what i looked like then it became set than i became that and this was an earlier this year how do you get that group of peter of anything they come from different countries different industries have different philosophies have a different education this is really really hard and i i reckon this is a picture of my major problem was supposed it is amazing that we have succeeded as far as return but let's see i'm going to talk lesseim how we got from well about there till twenty years from now to three years from now so there salutin regardest and in eleven the first one was seen ninety eight then fourteen and seventeen a sheepisles made improvement this was what we had you and all the previous decade and a bit stand arousal com every ten years we actually took thirteen which was one of the reasons we decided we careening this so we decided i will go to go on a three year sir and i told the lie what we had to live there is lots of rochelle lots of simplification one of the ways are working is that there's a language we can't take things away because of the billy how can you make it simple to use the answer is have features led simple and the general ones and then have rules for how to use them well now people say why don't you just throw away the old stuff well half of the pictures i had in the first two sides will break and people everybody wants two more inches and by the way the language is too big you should make it more and don't break my cook these are the sort of the the heart constraints on on on evolution and the we have taken as ascain such now we have three major in primitive implements of separate plan jesus and microsoft and by the way they shipped essentially or of separatin this year and the standard hasn't been signed off in geneva yet the technical kishon it in the technical guys have delivered the compilers lot of you be using the already we are delivering on time this is vital for the coup i mean remember we elevate not as much as our life would be delivered so separate ten years of experience long list you do up the lists violincello of places i am not going to go into details going through the slide any detail take for enacted i'm just going to show one example here of the palace so here an gone to say your problem in a contain a sea i want to find all the elements for he has the better you be and what i'm going to do it i'm going to return a point of each of those elements and let see an example here we have a stray strains contain of characters mary had all and here and so for each point a la comes out of fine or as result by giving it him and looking for the as i'm going to see the point really point to one if it doesn't the something seriously wrong okay so i see not the words i want this to test whether that was a that was made that was may and that was me the way we do it is restored a victor of pines the elements this case the type of sea is character char and for each ex in s sees the values right if it is pushed upon toilin over the result and return the victor now if this had been as he passed trinity eight program we would have had a furious performance bog there because men a victor for elements is not that expensive to passover i might have given it a megabates and returned a million points and even morgan hardware can feel copying a million points however modern lectures do not copy lamson that is too cheap so the difference between cheops eleven and she brought blessing is what you don't see you don't see any pointers you don't see any avocation should don't see any arrange checks its or gone away it done implicitly in places and if done efficiently so that's what different so for fourteen with finished even to the point here is sad when you have a large project before the end of the project before the shipping day to have a future free and while i secure freeze happens you learn things new can't do anything about it so for a stand the feature freezes about a year before you ship the standard as to having a major release you start using it and your line things you hadn't guessed you you you and so the idea is after three years we have had the feature freeze we have rid what the effect of the herb the usual the features are and we can fix it in time before the next feature for each and that's how we got she of past fourteen it complete eleven and for plan and it has lots of little things are the tesserae the graphical people really wanted by nary a constance so again the binary constance to be means it up it's a bit pan then we found the people caretto and if you obelisked we gay people did you separate us which are gustfully humans reading the code will alwaies in the things of simplify things by making bugs more or less likely and that what this do lots of things here member there still maintaining compasses we would like to get rid of some of the old crowd but we can't we trine of the thing to have been doing in the late framework we have a lorrequer for he named i do more compilin so a lot of people do the following they have some cold manes a value in there so they go to us to the pair on the side and they calculated by the use licentiate put it into their coat then you wait a cover of years and is now the wrong value and you have a magic constant or cold or both so we had request fell from the embarasses inditing for doing beatings at combines time they also sometimes want to put constance into rum and separates good enough for that act think it was but they didn't agree so here is an example somebody in the japanese and bedded injured a benedite industry wondered and intriguer rout function toyed at hinted that which they let we want to have it so that it can be calculated a commitee then you write the simpleton be confined this will be executed at comitiis trick the function has to be pure in the sense i cannot have side effects and it cannot operate on any date that is in this hackmens if somebody likes nice matematica functions just just require the constant that takes care of that problem for a long more allows the complately the information necessary to do this and if it did it for every function you couldn't compile really be programmed so it's important that we have to say it so we can oake the square old of mine and take guardant to three four and we don't have chose use a due to patent we don't have to do strange things from that cross to do it now she crassus to do the basic stuff and then sir handlebars so let's see we can do can comparative abstractions here is a little abstraction it's a week day of june the twenty first with thousand sixteen this is an example of use of my favorite date library this is this very nice i did right choosy we can do that a compilation i assert which is assert that is sure evaluated at comparative to see if it works so i'm saying that the big day of june twenty first tortuous sixteen to choose to and it is so this assertion does not fire but if it if i'd been wrong it would have i give me a compilers we can actually do no trivial computations at compiled time by the way this library is more efficient than anything else you've done for dates so it's not it has not become elegant by being inefficient so seventeen should have been a major release the idea was to pick up the interlinear of teetotal major released miners made and scruples seventeen it so if you have a companion the standards comedian rate of evolution or sepastian the many little features this what i mean this should have been grave it's only okay that is a little bit for everybody i think everybody will find something they like the proper is a there are maybe eighteen features and tiflin two of them you store might have to understand the other the rest of him as a nice power little library less a variant that susume way of feeling with witahoo but it's not great so let's see where we go from here and we need a guiding philosophy for kind of this we can't just say is this feature good let's take it is this feature good no let's not shake it what are the criteria what other direction for where we are going she basically my aims include complete chivaree safety as far oaring else good on one wild hardwater manhater is going to become as selifan first cumulation even though we are doing better chicken i i don't think that's a modesty it and facially brinded dreams that sir his love and the best is the enemy of good that since logan can just dream we're going to build thumping is going to be useful i want this to be used for in twenty twenty and i want the prototypes to be used able next year so i were going to do that that's an engineer right so make separate much benefit in avocations that is the ultimate aim and these are the sort of mosaic aims the challenges i i try to set the committee with the science so why floppish philosophers anyway so i sat only way of titania a direction and to have a creanga this is absolutely essential and it's more language is more than a collection of features and individual feature can be great and just be a distraction in the context of a type system and all the tinctures we watch to better we must have a balance with features and basically we don't want to have me a habit and the sintos non technical this is we had to get through to the deeps i actually wrote up some design criteria burly dan hers from a book i wrote about it the design never sosius if you want to know about the earlier volution or she paused that book and i wrote two papers for least programme languages conference which men find in my publication page that or to describe a lusion it's all of these features asking a war fast here because only got now but masonry by a real provence at i think theory is great for filing a problem on so decided that it needs to be sot i think theory is a lousy guide to what should be done and so don't have a sterile question affection if i can come up with a ninety nine percent solution i am not going to wait two years three years a decade for the last perceptions that seems like this i even read this fordeal and i'd like to point out two of the things a documented in ninety four and actually around them for for eighty four as before no imputation of taties now this surprises people who are used to see and such and even parts of separate but there's a difference between ideas and what you can get im go in to get this one son a lad but i haven't got to get nisroch is said secretes is a strongly type programming language with weak and fortement very wick but the undying system is this saying except pottery for some conversions at go both ways and anyway i really want to eliminate the prepossessing to do that it's really hard there's people got meanin of cold and searell ing me to get rid of the macos yelling is good red of the maros may they late laughed but i actually think we are going to get rid of the macro's in something like the windows colonel probably the worst mechelen earth and that is why they have decided they actually agreed to with me because that hell is what they're be living in for a while we are gone to make progress but memetis was early things we have stored so what are the watch i want to majesty the telling i want my definition of major is it something that changes the way you think about programming the way you think about building a system that's liftin of of major minor is everything else and what can we get i i i like science fiction but i don't like to talk to infection everything on this side actually has been implemented somewhere so that is all very milesians fiction and by the way that is a sore of slides i really was very afower cool what i learnt to talk us adams were programming and cheapest\n"

      "i'm going to tell you a little bit about so post plus and most such talk i labour what the language is or how you use it this i'm trying to make a talk about how the language became to be what it is and is the see ablution from the early days of the bar three years from now and if i get a bit boring you can look at the pictures essentially all other pictures has something or other to do with superlative what do you think those turbines and programmed it and so that's it i am going to go libitina what as she possesses rolling the world what is what did i intended to be and what what what what is it now then i'm going to give a code of sample i really feel like a toad if i talk about programming and so divilment without showing coat i mean if you see a presentation about soft were elopement without cold i start to worry and then i'm going to talk about the recent evolution a lot of the talk has to do with what has happened in the last minute plus three years omelike that and my my thesis here is said there the very of prodigue is a quality of the applications what matters is what interesting things should do with it that is my mither of success not the how clever code i can see the intercom purforate this this is this is very much a practical exercise trying to to do something good in the world of course on control what people are using the language for some of the things you might not like but these other things i i consider a somewhat cool and i am not ponto into into langworthy not to be ruled about she cast pacifications so that said i you are not going to drag me into tolerates lots of interesting stuff here and so what i've been doing since my ph d days is sir to sissy stems and i'm so very interested in that doing it there is my one of my notions of a distributer system it's a distribute or system with wiggles and a lot of the prepostors up in places where you would never think about it and you were never see it if it works right it's a if you notice it supererogation on the point he is a nobody understands all of this nobody can understand it any depth all the applications that i was just figuring through a few pictures of miladi however the purposely exercise as far as i am concerned is to help people that appealing these things therefore if i build something that can only do what i can imagine i failed you have to do things i couldn't possibly imagine the group here has more ideas more needs than i could imagine and and that's part of the point so what italy matters the answer is not of things and the one theme here is that when we need to be litanei we need a language to a border or those to avoid so that it can handle new things the world is changing we changing that the challenges a changing and the language has to do it on the other hand you are seen languages that are really cold for that five years then there desire i get a promotion and die we would can't have that not for things at last for they ate a lot of the things on my pictures had the interesting property that they will ripen ten fifteen twenty years ago they are still being developed and changed you have to handle that span that's really high and obviously there or not in this kind of stuff to talk for days i have one heart i'd like to point out that the best being the best of one or two things is not sufficient me that's how i can write a really nice paper a mutant eepers i agreed a lot of them i have ridden a fair number of them but that is not the end product for two building a too is good enough if it is good enough for everything that somebody using it neat now you have to remember that no language is good enough for everybody and for everything but if you should use a cord it should be good enough at what at every aspect of what you're doing not just being the best of something and so let her go back and see what the world was like when when i started for papias mostly black and white it seemed that is a large computer it a perependev he yet allows a programme to have twentieth cof memory and it runs with old almost a megaton onward and this is there is ricketson working on it noise highly advanced i sister ah that was what the world looked like and there's lots of things seated in her function prototypes i hadn't invented them yet so i didn't have to say of the art in a static development yes lots of languages has functioned argument shaking a conversion but satiates all kinds o stop keepers were cooled into one hundred they didn't even have one that utilitate one of the point is at every body knew that object oriented was useless this is almost right because ninety nine per cent of peboan what occupant was never heard of it and of the one set new about it knew it wouldn't work it was tusitala purpose and the difficult ordinary mortals to use and i tried to convince somebody is if you want to virtual function you haven't done your analysis right me you want to carnacion you know i don't know what i wanted is a lisette was some obstacle to all come i point this out because in retrospect the lot of this looks trivial and easy so i probably won't convince you but it wasn't easy so here's oropastes as it relates to see peplus year it's a line of the bellomont where the purse of the exercise is to extract every single bite every single since out of the machine started with a simple machine cold go through peace planchenoit we have the the great improvement in programming the greatest in history which is basing somebody figaro that we should have human oriented things at picton specific concepts in a language so that we can talk about our programmes in the capillaries when we design things as opposed to loathe machine or the time that's for time and as soon as people had fortune robustness ever wander one they got cold boar everybody wanted one and very surely had about twenty of them and had the native that everybody could write in a specific domain much more pleasant than a temblador they couldn't talk to a jo the terminology was different the days are formed with different they could even exchange data so simile a came about together with ober dorian de programming as an attempt to say why put application specific concept into a program lane to ch why don't we instead give the program as the ability to design their own abstractions they all concepts on types and that's how we got up tortora ing and if you write it any programming language that course of type a class you can say thanks true or a cristino go there because that's where i came from a computer science was very new he was trained as a man musician in new or classes was he did not know what types were and so i needed something that could handle a traction and could handle hardware and that's why i bilious by allowing abstraction maenius there and lots of interesting things happened after that now she passed us is as far as i am concerned there so that i don't have to choose between elegance mischancy when i do things well they are elegant and efficient that is when you express things really well really clear really logically consistent hopefully the optimist and generates really good cook that's the idea and sometimes we get it to get it all the time and we can do even better but let's see idea and we do that by defining life wait abstractions not fit heavy complicated abstractions ethereality want a point than the matricule no boy gets really quite difficult and that's where the challenges are and so she postponed as language for resource constrained applications there's lots of applications it is on those pictures lothario on well starting in the eight years and still to day where you could do much better i had twice as much memory ought twice as many processes or traces fast processes but you don't those servants course sixty million us dollars and if you are cold is half the speed of what it should be you need to buy two and you have to power them up and run them and maintain them in all of this kind of stuff so this is where a resource contained manners and that means as he plutus's deep deep in our usurpature because that's where you have the constraints of performance and reliability and holland she amended abstraction those of those two lines on the history child and again no language is perfect by everything in everybody and i don't know how many of you have have read the dragon book it's a case takes book in a about how to be compiled it shows the night at with the weapons of computer science defeating the dragon of complexity sometimes the dragon went we haven't reached perfection we can do much better so he is one i mean by a direct map to hardware the premature operations met to instructions on the set if you add to or introduce its the air into your hair to operation seems simple but along with one languages don't do it memory is just as a sequence of objects you often bites and you have addresses the concho which bit which optical king about that's it it's a brilliantly simple abstraction that the distraction made you can compose object the simperton like you take some of the same type and put them next to a job you get an array if you put things that are different hopes together you can get struck some classes and things like that and if you need to refer to something that elsewhere you have points that are simply simply machine addresses and sweeteners so pacing this is the real secret of sea and splashes it's really simple it's real easy to map to the hardware its compact its sufficient okay so down by the hard warlike is actually rather on pleasant because there's not much help and you don't really want to work with bitonto and such all the time and and and rollins and such so we want to abstract from it and so the basic idea of cupolas is a should allow you to be your own type and they should follow what i call the serio had principal what you don't go you don't pay pay for and what you do you you shouldn't be able to hand coat any better so if i am providing a notion of a truss you should not be able to hand codeine and struck such a tapering better and there's lots of examples here and finally sometimes redon actin to generate any cold and of compute the answer compile that's getting more and more popular so here it abstractions or the way down we start with our high level of tractions la build on lower level of strikin a build on the language which builds on the on the basic machine made and the machine model is also an abstraction of course there is much more that to a machine agatha the last cases and all kinds of our stuff like that this is an attraction this is denis's abstraction it's a good one i borrowed it and you go down to get to the heart were and what are you find no and interlachen does not execute a design structions directly it translated six instructions into a much nicer instruction set which it can obtuse execute better its attractions or widow institutes and you always have tobacko concrete examples there are people who think abstraction is another word for blot this is not the case you do it right you after i found concrete examples maintaining performance or the way off and you have to keep simple things simple because sometimes when you abstract things so he can do everything you can do nothing simply you want simple things to be simple these sort design principles are a work with a will and then there is question of man how did she plutus get to be cause plutus well it was an an allange he of course splenetically stood for cambridge program language that they ran out of money and the combined with imperial and was combined programming language and then was to congregated the cold builded nettie except they built a simple thing larich a phisician then it became be for short while and sea was denis's work that made efficient and beeroo hanway used and then she repasses a sidecar for about three years till hours told i couldn't call it separes because some people were calling see old sea annotator to denis i was not rude to denyeth him most days and beeves up we've never had a harsh word between us and there i tried to call it see she put so eighty four that never flew because the pedro the sea committed came and said well please don't do that gun it would really be embarrassing if a super side of see eighty five the standard sea would urbanity confinement was not so i had a competition or for calling it a something and a secular one and she said we knew proposed matter is cambridge all combined because everybody knew it took for christopher she that you stole i should point out that mary hill where i worked and we designed she pluffles right oother and let's congregator the separator well we had a competition a commers ago for what is your favourite she pustular and when roger or suggested the incur we all backed off that they can't be beat that's it that's where all the magic happens so one of the things that distinguishes he proposes is this model you you you may object we constructors and if you don't say anything else the escopeta and no school the destructor fires doing the magic cleaning up the messes closing up what should be closed on that that's surely he and i looked at my notes and it's a real course he pressed buskin the first two weeks of the bellmen back in a seventeen nine together with classes member unconsenting function decorations now a good stuff like that and being that is the key to a lot of what we are doing to day the stand alive uses it there are handling is depending credit is it hesitatin type a class it has two parts the popping in surface and the implementation so basin you this is one level of abstraction and that is a low level obstruction on which it is built and you work that up and down all the way as i have given it there's an element type and it tapioca construct this one by a list of initials of its elements type and here is the can of function that's where you release the memory you do so here we can use it i take a back coldwatham window constance and i take a victor of strings with some well known language to sign this i would like to point out i been using the light for years i did not put it into greece you this this is this is this is the way i do it and be basically we get to the curly here it goes on tramp everything that was created by the objects in that scope and that's a very powerful attraction they can so we use it for just about everything in the superposed of library the victors mists mathusalem strings and such they are are working on this model you acquire resources when you were when you when you create a variable and you regain at the end of the scope and this is this a thing that we acquire an not just memory there things like threatenin bulbosus for four streams locks and when we have smart pointers we do use counts and things like that this means that if you can't just fire alegaiter and collect all the memory not only would that give you long o resource retention because instead of creaming up the mess you leave the mist for somebody else to clean up later therefore the resources held on for much longer so much garments shows an average twice anyway and this work securely to if i have something like a gadget which holds a five hand diana lock and such and a victor of records contain or worse it were folly okay so let's take a more concrete example semi concrete there's a gate i created with some initials and i get a pointer out there this is the way we rotoli the in the eight is this is the way they wrote cold and sellin the sixties is nothing new here and were seeing too much of it but anyway this is what we do we don't accent this one does its constructors all the resources necessary for working well and knowledge redtown here and if this easter withdraws something if is that we return and when we have finished we delete lubec again i mean we acquire using a new witnesses as you see sometimes we don't get there so he was spring me one age collection because this is easy to forget its easy to get wrong articulation get there a return with to get there so his leaks and so it comes said you you don't really want new sitting out there naked and you don't want the leach being there naked because they carlavero strongly with bars she want to get rid of it that easy way of getting rid of it is that instead of having the cadet made by new we have a function in sandebar can make shift it makes her object of that type with that initial and return as she appoint a ship point as a counter point when the last ship pointed to an object is destroyed the use count has gone to syro it destroys a object it one and therefore we will have detected destroyed there there and there and the problem goes away except that now we have she appoints and we have used constant this violates a sera principle because we have to excess that use corrupted and reset in a misty threaded environment that is at a costly operation because labe synchronized and anyway i don't want to crave garage i can't see any garbage here that needs to be collected i can't see anything lorrequer i used to i have one point and i goes away why do i have to count sire on sir no we can do better actually the same to code is there you just take a local variable come to it you use it and the destruction be called there they are there because when you go out of scope to the structures court problem sort and the cold shower and so don't use now in general code because they belong in resource management code so if i see it let in your cold i assume there's a bug that you have two fumana if i see a new i know you need a belesme where so i shall as a banaotovich simple and if you really need points amidst be counted you don't know a lot on aship yet she appoints there is italy quite useful but of people all oussoor problem that is quite awfully make a big object so lots of data and then we wanted to get out of the function that did it get back to the weariest ed it and this is what people used pointsman they use free store or to own a steamer or heap they out to that alencon of back one have all the problems back again so we need to avoid thing so here i make the cadet and here returned and conventionally when we can have something that a copy so basely here i call if and here we caeteris now must point out that only a computer science is could have thought of that so to get this one from here should there you make a copy or were they and you destroy your original no baby is about four to six months or wild now here it is now your there now to beg again they can figure it out so we just have to make sure that that's what we do so here is jean it's a gadget and if it's a big thing like a matrix abettance tion of stuff out the stuff booboorowie the free store and loss a handle to it so all we need to do is to prophane introduce in the hand of is that the small if this is a material it three words and then we cut the connection to the first gate so the destructor doesn't er get to throw away the good stuff and problem so and so the course of getting say amagay the stuff out if you do it like this is why childer memory as i had meant and now you know roger have to worry about pointers memory management of shippons nor this doth this complete spectral of the life sideless have been doing this since the ninth is but its only became systematic and guaranteed that it could be done in the sipahis is the handiwork of guy caught howard hand that found out how to show were formalized that so that easily done now or so i'd like one talk about evolution to point out that i have never claimed she plus plus is an object orient language it never was just an object orient the language is never meant to be just enough citrine language i don't think everything should be in past higher is any of the stuff so she prefers not affectation did for any definition of objector for stars we need to deal with this diagraming charter when hardware tends to be massy so we have to do things that the tube like objects in a real way they actually real world objects and you you have to oecumenical we want marsmen for some things so a b a b comes be mean they had the same value and what evocation of the one doesn't fix the all this is what we do for insides for complex numbers for points for victors et cetera so that that's always been in spirally think this a nice notation this is a nicest notation and such and i don't want to have two versions of a sniff i add a rating point number two inside i don't want in the insides to have something as hate fuligine numbers in the floating point number the class takes one thing as takin tides i i want the the old fashion by three under years old notations that it for other more generic programming was always part of of the separate plan so i left doesn't fit with the octette days they control rose protasis by an iota committee and the way that happened was that representatives from h p and sun turned over my office and explained to me that i wanted to extend the diseases willis answered went ready it's not finished it to a project and they so twisted my arm a a and in the end a cities the argument was that you could not have a language our major language poorly controlled by a sin single company every body believed that those days it had been proven on true people using java and see sharp even though they are owned and operated by an individual a company that might be your competitive anyway at the time nobody believes that could be done they have not thought about the advertising campaign acadian the allayment was for a blunt well we will not trust you so there employ or eighteen the we will of course trust you but you could get ronneby a bus in the foot and so i agreed to send alicia many kinds of standardisation at the eyes ostentation here is sort of the gold standard of ostentation is thorough it open and the hasrat we get lit long terms ability which is a feature an important feature to many of the major uses its mendaeans really hard to sororities sold favors my company ravensdene designed by a comedy is horrible stagnation could happen if people decided not to do major things because they couldn't agree on which major things to do there's divergent or action of the sign if you get sufficient number of people aconitin and they have a temple of all elaborating any individual feature you can see that in seclusion places i'm not going to go into detail i'm just going to show you a picture of the committee so this is what i looked like then it became set than i became that and this was an earlier this year how do you get that group of peter of anything they come from different countries different industries have different philosophies have a different education this is really really hard and i i reckon this is a picture of my major problem was supposed it is amazing that we have succeeded as far as return but let's see i'm going to talk lesseim how we got from well about there till twenty years from now to three years from now so there salutin regardest and in eleven the first one was seen ninety eight then fourteen and seventeen a sheepisles made improvement this was what we had you and all the previous decade and a bit stand arousal com every ten years we actually took thirteen which was one of the reasons we decided we careening this so we decided i will go to go on a three year sir and i told the lie what we had to live there is lots of rochelle lots of simplification one of the ways are working is that there's a language we can't take things away because of the billy how can you make it simple to use the answer is have features led simple and the general ones and then have rules for how to use them well now people say why don't you just throw away the old stuff well half of the pictures i had in the first two sides will break and people everybody wants two more inches and by the way the language is too big you should make it more and don't break my cook these are the sort of the the heart constraints on on on evolution and the we have taken as ascain such now we have three major in primitive implements of separate plan jesus and microsoft and by the way they shipped essentially or of separatin this year and the standard hasn't been signed off in geneva yet the technical kishon it in the technical guys have delivered the compilers lot of you be using the already we are delivering on time this is vital for the coup i mean remember we elevate not as much as our life would be delivered so separate ten years of experience long list you do up the lists violincello of places i am not going to go into details going through the slide any detail take for enacted i'm just going to show one example here of the palace so here an gone to say your problem in a contain a sea i want to find all the elements for he has the better you be and what i'm going to do it i'm going to return a point of each of those elements and let see an example here we have a stray strains contain of characters mary had all and here and so for each point a la comes out of fine or as result by giving it him and looking for the as i'm going to see the point really point to one if it doesn't the something seriously wrong okay so i see not the words i want this to test whether that was a that was made that was may and that was me the way we do it is restored a victor of pines the elements this case the type of sea is character char and for each ex in s sees the values right if it is pushed upon toilin over the result and return the victor now if this had been as he passed trinity eight program we would have had a furious performance bog there because men a victor for elements is not that expensive to passover i might have given it a megabates and returned a million points and even morgan hardware can feel copying a million points however modern lectures do not copy lamson that is too cheap so the difference between cheops eleven and she brought blessing is what you don't see you don't see any pointers you don't see any avocation should don't see any arrange checks its or gone away it done implicitly in places and if done efficiently so that's what different so for fourteen with finished even to the point here is sad when you have a large project before the end of the project before the shipping day to have a future free and while i secure freeze happens you learn things new can't do anything about it so for a stand the feature freezes about a year before you ship the standard as to having a major release you start using it and your line things you hadn't guessed you you you and so the idea is after three years we have had the feature freeze we have rid what the effect of the herb the usual the features are and we can fix it in time before the next feature for each and that's how we got she of past fourteen it complete eleven and for plan and it has lots of little things are the tesserae the graphical people really wanted by nary a constance so again the binary constance to be means it up it's a bit pan then we found the people caretto and if you obelisked we gay people did you separate us which are gustfully humans reading the code will alwaies in the things of simplify things by making bugs more or less likely and that what this do lots of things here member there still maintaining compasses we would like to get rid of some of the old crowd but we can't we trine of the thing to have been doing in the late framework we have a lorrequer for he named i do more compilin so a lot of people do the following they have some cold manes a value in there so they go to us to the pair on the side and they calculated by the use licentiate put it into their coat then you wait a cover of years and is now the wrong value and you have a magic constant or cold or both so we had request fell from the embarasses inditing for doing beatings at combines time they also sometimes want to put constance into rum and separates good enough for that act think it was but they didn't agree so here is an example somebody in the japanese and bedded injured a benedite industry wondered and intriguer rout function toyed at hinted that which they let we want to have it so that it can be calculated a commitee then you write the simpleton be confined this will be executed at comitiis trick the function has to be pure in the sense i cannot have side effects and it cannot operate on any date that is in this hackmens if somebody likes nice matematica functions just just require the constant that takes care of that problem for a long more allows the complately the information necessary to do this and if it did it for every function you couldn't compile really be programmed so it's important that we have to say it so we can oake the square old of mine and take guardant to three four and we don't have chose use a due to patent we don't have to do strange things from that cross to do it now she crassus to do the basic stuff and then sir handlebars so let's see we can do can comparative abstractions here is a little abstraction it's a week day of june the twenty first with thousand sixteen this is an example of use of my favorite date library this is this very nice i did right choosy we can do that a compilation i assert which is assert that is sure evaluated at comparative to see if it works so i'm saying that the big day of june twenty first tortuous sixteen to choose to and it is so this assertion does not fire but if it if i'd been wrong it would have i give me a compilers we can actually do no trivial computations at compiled time by the way this library is more efficient than anything else you've done for dates so it's not it has not become elegant by being inefficient so seventeen should have been a major release the idea was to pick up the interlinear of teetotal major released miners made and scruples seventeen it so if you have a companion the standards comedian rate of evolution or sepastian the many little features this what i mean this should have been grave it's only okay that is a little bit for everybody i think everybody will find something they like the proper is a there are maybe eighteen features and tiflin two of them you store might have to understand the other the rest of him as a nice power little library less a variant that susume way of feeling with witahoo but it's not great so let's see where we go from here and we need a guiding philosophy for kind of this we can't just say is this feature good let's take it is this feature good no let's not shake it what are the criteria what other direction for where we are going she basically my aims include complete chivaree safety as far oaring else good on one wild hardwater manhater is going to become as selifan first cumulation even though we are doing better chicken i i don't think that's a modesty it and facially brinded dreams that sir his love and the best is the enemy of good that since logan can just dream we're going to build thumping is going to be useful i want this to be used for in twenty twenty and i want the prototypes to be used able next year so i were going to do that that's an engineer right so make separate much benefit in avocations that is the ultimate aim and these are the sort of mosaic aims the challenges i i try to set the committee with the science so why floppish philosophers anyway so i sat only way of titania a direction and to have a creanga this is absolutely essential and it's more language is more than a collection of features and individual feature can be great and just be a distraction in the context of a type system and all the tinctures we watch to better we must have a balance with features and basically we don't want to have me a habit and the sintos non technical this is we had to get through to the deeps i actually wrote up some design criteria burly dan hers from a book i wrote about it the design never sosius if you want to know about the earlier volution or she paused that book and i wrote two papers for least programme languages conference which men find in my publication page that or to describe a lusion it's all of these features asking a war fast here because only got now but masonry by a real provence at i think theory is great for filing a problem on so decided that it needs to be sot i think theory is a lousy guide to what should be done and so don't have a sterile question affection if i can come up with a ninety nine percent solution i am not going to wait two years three years a decade for the last perceptions that seems like this i even read this fordeal and i'd like to point out two of the things a documented in ninety four and actually around them for for eighty four as before no imputation of taties now this surprises people who are used to see and such and even parts of separate but there's a difference between ideas and what you can get im go in to get this one son a lad but i haven't got to get nisroch is said secretes is a strongly type programming language with weak and fortement very wick but the undying system is this saying except pottery for some conversions at go both ways and anyway i really want to eliminate the prepossessing to do that it's really hard there's people got meanin of cold and searell ing me to get rid of the macos yelling is good red of the maros may they late laughed but i actually think we are going to get rid of the macro's in something like the windows colonel probably the worst mechelen earth and that is why they have decided they actually agreed to with me because that hell is what they're be living in for a while we are gone to make progress but memetis was early things we have stored so what are the watch i want to majesty the telling i want my definition of major is it something that changes the way you think about programming the way you think about building a system that's liftin of of major minor is everything else and what can we get i i i like science fiction but i don't like to talk to infection everything on this side actually has been implemented somewhere so that is all very milesians fiction and by the way that is a sore of slides i really was very afower cool what i learnt to talk us adams were programming and cheapest\n"
