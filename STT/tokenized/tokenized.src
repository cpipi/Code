i ' m going to tell you a deliberate citrus plus and most such talk try about what the language is or how we use it this i ' m trying to make a talk about how the language became to be what it is and is its evolution from the early days of the bare years from now and if i get up i boring you can look at the pictures i essentially all of the pictures or something or other to do with super ##pose what do you think those turbines have been programmed in and so that ' s it i am going to go limp ##ed into what is she proposes rolling the world what is it what did i intended to be and what what what what is it now then i ' m going to give a code a temple i really feel like a tile or fraud of a talk about programming and so far of el ##ope ##ment without showing code i mean if you see it this presentation about south ##wear ##e with our cold i start to worry and then i ' m going to talk about the reason of lot ##ion a lot of the tale has to do with what has happened in the last minute plus three years something like that and at my my thesis here i says there the vale of programming language is the quality of the applications what matters is what interesting thing she do with it that is my measure of success not the how clever cold i can see into a deer column power ##boat this this is this is very much a practical exercise trying to do something good in the world of course you don ' t control what he b ##lous ##ing the language for in some of the things you might not like but these are the things i i consider her somewhat cold and i am not going to enter into lang ##uo ##rs i am i try not to be rude about the pas ##pa ##hey ##ans so that said i you are not going to drag me into to them and and this lots of interesting stuff here and so on i ' ve been doing since my paddy is distributed to systems and i ' m so very interested in that doing it there is a my one of my notions of a distribute ##s it ' s a distribute ##s with wheels and a lot of sea prospect ##ors up in places way you would never think about it and you will never see it if it worked right it ' s a if you notice it separates probably cause something went wrong at the point he is and nobody understands or of this nobody can understand it any depth or the af ##flict ##ions that i will just li ##gger ##ing through a few pictures of mil ##adi however the purpose the exercise as far as i am concerned is to help people that a feeding these things therefore if i build something that can only do what i can imagine i failed you have to do things i couldn ' t possibly imagine the cruel here has more ideas more need than i could imagine and and that ' s part of the point so what actually matters to the answer is lots of things and on a one thing here i said we meet me needs to be lit in evolution we need a language to a bore our choices ##t avoid so that it can handle new things the world is changing which ang ##ing that the challenges are changing and the language has to do it on the other hand you are seen languages that are really cooled for about five years then the desire get a promotion and he dies we would can ' t have that not for things that last but the case a lot of the things on my pictures had the interesting property that they were rep ##ente ##nt twenty years ago they are still being developed and changed you have to handle that span that ' s really high and obviously there ' s enough in this kind of stuff to talk for days i have one heart i ' d like to point out that the best in the best of one or two things is not sufficient meta ' s how he can write a really nice paper and matt ##ing gains ##t academic papers i agreed a lot of them i have ridden a fair number of them but let us not be into product for to building a toy is good enough if it is good enough but everything that somebody using it neat ##h now you have to remember that no language is good enough for everybody and for everything but if you should use a cord it should be good enough at what at every aspect of what you ' re doing not just being the best of something and so let ' s or go back and see what the world was like when when i started in on coal of was mostly black and white seemed a that is a large computer it ' s a pen ##ep ##lain seventy it allows a program at o have two hundred and fifty a came ##ry and it runs with all or most the mag ##at on you onward and this is there ' s red ##hand ken thompson working on it noticed the highly advanced i os ##ten ##tat was what the world looked like and as there ' s lots of things she didn ' t have function prototypes i hadn ' t invented them yet so i didn ' t have to and alive was the stay of the art in the static or table yes lots of languages has function argument shaking and conversion but seemed there ' s all kinds stop pe ##le ##les were cruel i see one hundred they given have one that ' s utilities one of the point is that every body knew that object oriented was useless this is almost right because ninety nine per cent of people didn ' t know what occupied was never heard of it and of the one that knew about it knew it wouldn ' t work it was so slow to special purpose on choi ##sit par ##dner mortals to use and i tried to convince somebody says if you want to vi ##rt ##uo ##so you haven ' t done you eli ##cit me you want to call a function you know who don ' t know what you want it is it ' s me sir so the the was some obstacle to all come a point this out because in retro ##sp ##ect the lot of this looks trivial and easy so i probably won ' t convince you but it wasn ' t easy so here ' s a sort of a straight chart ##ists to see po ##cus here is a line of the bell ##omo ##nt where the per ##vas ##ive is to extract every single bite every single cycle out of the machine so with a single machine go through peace peace and then to see castles and up here we have heard the great improvement in programming the greatest in history which is basin ##g somebody figure out that we should have human oriented things application she was civic concert in a language so that we can talk upon our programmes in the cap ##ill ##us when we design things as opposed to love at the machine all the time that fortune and as soon as people had font ##ine ##ttes pep ##e wandered one they got cold board everybody wanted one and very slowly had about twenty of them and had the nee ##fi ##t that everybody could write in a specific domain much more pleasant than a simple however the couldn ' t talk to a ole the terminology was different the data i formed with different they couldn ' t even exchange data so se ##ir ##ce about together will oct ##oro ##on the programming as an attempt to say why put application be civic concept into a program language why don ' t we instead give the program as the ability to design their own abstraction ##s that own concepts the own chips and that ' s how we got up cot ##one ##r ming and if you write it any programming language said course a type a class you can say thanks true or a question there because that ' s where it came from a computer science was very new he will sir train as mai ##mie what classes was he did not know what types were and so i needed something that could handle a traction and could handle her where and that why bill she purity allowing a traction making mister b use there and lots of interesting things happened after that now she passes is as far as i am concerned there so that i don ' t have to choose between elegant re ##tic ##ency when i do think well they are elegant and efficient that is when you express things really well really clear a really logical consistent hopefully the opt ##imi ##st og ##le and de ##gen ##erate ##s really good cook that ' s the idea and sometimes we get it to get it all the time and we can do even better but let ' s see idea and we do that by defining like way abstraction ##s not feet heavy complicated attractions that they are relative easy and you can do the man any language but if you want to point the nam ##ara ##s and the complex nobody gets really quite difficult and that well he challenges are and so she put last been developed as language for resource constrained applications there ' s lots of applications that he saw on those pictures lots of stop that i worked on well starting in the eight years and still to day where you could do much better if her twice as much memory ought twice as many processes or tri ##ce ' s first processes but you don ' t those serve or harm coarse ##st million us dollars and if you are cold is half the speed of what it should be you need to buy two and you have to power the up and run them and maintain them in all of this kind of stuff so this is where resource a constrained manner and that he to silas flush as deep in our ear sole ##nst ##ral ##e because let where you have the constraints of performance and reliability and ortega she preface ##s at irene to her where and see a head abstraction those of those two lines on the history cha ##land again no language is perfectly within in everybody and i don ' t know how many of you have hatred the dragon book it ' s o ##cr ##isi ##a cha ##kor ##e in a about how to be com ##pile ##s it shows the knight am with the weapons of computer science if hee ##ding the dragon of complexity sometimes the driving ##est reached perfection and we can do much better so here ' s what i mean by a direct map to hardware the pri ##mie ##ro ' s met through instructions on the set if you add to or int ##rigue its the air inter ##grad ##ation seemed simple but along with other languages don ' t do it memory is just as a sequence of objects you op ##ie often bites and you have addresses for on shore which by the witch or take you or talking about that ' s it it ' s a brilliant resemble abstraction that tension i am you can compose of jack the sy ##mpt ##om on ate ##nti ##on fl ##ie you take some of the same type and put them next to a job you get an array if you put things at a different types together you can get struck and classes and things like that and if you need to refer to something that ' s got where you have pointer ##s that are simply a simple machine addresses and witness place this is the real secret of sen ##su ##ous it ' s really simple is really easy to map to the heart were its compact ##ed sufficient okay so down by the heart where life is rec ##lot ##he on pleasant because there ' s not much help and you don ' t really want to work with bites and then words and such or the time and enroll pointer ##s and such so we want to abstract from it and so the basic idea of separate and should allow you to build your own caps and they should follow what i call the hero or head principle what you don ' t do you don ' t pay tai ##fa ##la ##e you do us i shouldn ' t be able to hand cold any better so i am providing and notion of a class you should not be able to hand code e ##well ##ing pointer ##s and the st ##rop ##s and that as anything better and there ' s lots of examples here and finally sometimes red accent ##uate any cold just compute the answer compiled or that ' s getting more and more popular so here it abstraction ##s all the way down we start with our high level attractions lay build on lo ##eve ##nstein they build on the language which builds on the o ##ar on the basic machine model and the machine model is a show in abstraction of course there is much more that a machine age che ##ila ##nt ##hes the left catches and or kinds of of our stuff like that this is abstraction is tension is a good one i borrowed it and you go down and get to the hard ware and what are you find no an ins ##ulating does not execute a defiant st ##ru ##ctions directly it translated six instructions into a much nice ##r instruction said which he can optimistic ##al its sub ##tra ##ctions or lay down instead you always have traps back from concrete examples there are prem ##onis ##hing abstraction is another word for brothers is not the case i do it right you action concrete examples maintaining performance all the way up and you have to keep simple things in bore ##as sometimes when you have strike ##ing to the condo ##ver thing you can do nothing simply you want simple things to be simple these outside principles are of work will ones then there is question namely how did she purple ##s yet to be cause you purpose well he wasn ' t an lang ##wi ##sh he a course he pedal ##ed for cameras program language then they ran out of a money in the combined with the imperial men was combined programming language and then was too cong ##re ##gated the could build ##ed it tied except they filled a simple thing mu ##sh ##ra ##bi ##yeh that adam ##ite and then it became be for short while and see was ten ##ny ##son ' s work that made efficient and benefactor han ##ways and then she replaces a seal ' s court for about three years till ousted i couldn ' t call i see i classes because some people were calling sea old sea and as rose the road to tan ##is i was not rotten ##est him more days and he never sat up we bee ##ver had a harsh word between us and ether ##ical it sea she put a sea eighty four that neat ##le because the pe ##lf the sea committee and said well consent that yarn it will really be embarrassing if a super said or see eighty five the standard see would be a shear ##ed off see if any way they didn ' t finish to eighty nine when any way ali ##wal not so i had a competition i have for calling it a something and sera ##pio ##n as to say we knew progress was to anti ##ci ##pate but that was too much of duke ah so what is a state she doing up there ye answer ##man a sign of sheep and it didn ' t matter welles kim ##eb ##ridge all combined because everybody knew to po ##ise to pet you to at it there oh oh i shaping out that marriage i worked and were designed sea ##port or as they are and let ' s cambridge paid so that what features the sera ##pis offer well we had a competition a couple of years ago for what is your favourite she was brushed picture and when royalties to inc ##ur we ought back of that that they can ' t be be betty that ' s where all the mach ##ich ##aco one of the things that distinguishes she proposed boer ##s is this model you make up get it construct ##ors and if you don ' t say anything else the ins ##cape and at the end scope the des ##truct ##or fires a doing the mate cream ##ing up the mess ##es closing up what should be close on that that ' s a real and i looked at my notes and desire are cause he pressed po ##sic ##les two weeks of the bell ##omo ##nt back in na ##rent ##a nine together with classes member functions information hiding function decorations mala ##cott ##a like this and patient is the key to a lot of what we are doing to day the standard library uses it they are handling is depending a pre ##tti ##ly on it so what is it yes a chip austin type a class it has two parts the pop ##ino ##ts and the implementation soul face o this is one level of abstraction and lad ##is ##law ever obstruction on which it is built and you work that often down all the way and i have given it as an element type and it this you can construct this one by a list of initials of pet ##ula ##nce and here in the can ##opus ##ian that ' s where you release the memory do so you are we can use it i take a back chocolate in known constance and i take a victor of strings with some well known language designers i would like to point out i been using the light for years i did not put it into greece this this is this is this is the way i do it and be pac ##ience it goes on pri ##nse ##p everything that was created by the object and that scope and the letter very pale for abstraction the can ##is so we use it for just about everything in the su ##pr ##ac ##ilia ##ry there ' s victor ##s lists matches have strange and such they are they are working on this model you acquire resources when you would when you when you create a variable and you resign at the end of the score and this is these are things that we acquire not just memory the things like fright handles fire hand bull ##ace ##s yes for for streams a luck and when we have smart pointer ##s we do use counts and things like that this means cal ##ific ##ator sire other ga ##rb ##ed correct ##or and collect all the memory not only would that give you long ago we sha ##gree ##n ti ##on because instead of cleaning up the mess you leave the mess for somebody else to pen up later therefore the resources held on for much longer so much vera ##ment shows an average twice anyway and this work securely so if i have something like a cat we hold a fire handling and such and a bacteria the container wo ##rret ##ed work ol ##low ##ay okay so let ' s take a more concrete table san ##iko ##nr ##a there ' s a gate i created with some initiative and i get a pointer of then this is the way we oder ##lin then in the eight years this is the way they wrote cold and see ##in the sixties is nothing new here and we see too much of it but anyway this is what we do we don ' t act know what this one does its construct ##or grabs all louis arc ##es necessary for working well and a knowledge radius and the god ##own here and if there ' s eel ##y or withdraw something if existed we return and one may finished we hardly the to ##uth ##ope again i mean we are qui ##re using a new wild meat to wireless verses you sing a time however as you see sometimes we don ' t get there so he was spring ##y one arbitration because this is easy of a getting wrong is particular with throw away don ' t get the weather with a gen ##t that so his legs and so it comes that you you don ' t really want new sitting out there in the kit and you don ' t want the light being there naked because they call it very strongly with but you want to get rid of it that an easy way of getting rid of it is that instead of having the cadet made by new we have a function in spend ##er cold make share it makes an object of that type would that any sal ##lie and return a sheer point acheron ##tis accounted point when the last ship pointed from object is destroyed the use count has gone to sea in the st ##roud object it on and therefore we will have died the gates destroyed there they are and blair and turn the problem goes away except that now we have a sheep ##in and we have used comes and this violate ##s a serra principle because we have to access that use counter ##pan ##e and real sit in her whole she threaded environment that is as a court ##ly operation because as ##es ##ino i ##zed and anyway i don ' t want to create garbage i can ' t see any garbage here that needs to be collected i can ' t see anything very qui ##re you put i have one point and it goes away why do i have to count ser ##ions no we can do better actually the same to cold ##s there you just take a local variable a comet ##ary new uses and the des ##truct ##or be called there they are there because when you go out of school the des ##truct ##ors court problem sort and to cold shorter and so don ' t use knew in general a cot a because they belong in resource management cold so if i see it i let in your cold i assume that a bog that you have two feet many ten ##ets and if i see a new i know you need a del ##ew ##are so i shall mis ##eran ##s this is much simpler and if you really need pointer ##s as is to be counted you don ' t know about almost you yet she appoint ##ees there is a e ##qui ##te useful but opera or used so this leave your son one problem that is quite awful ##ly make a big object so lots of data and then we wanted to get out of the function that did it give back to the wherever requested it and this is what people use pointer ##s for and they use free store or to one adam ##ic memory or hip they use that a man in the point of back and i ' ll have all the problems ba ##cine ##t so we need to avoid that so here i make the ga ##dget in her eternity and conventional ##ly when we turn a something that cab ##by so basin ##g my here i called it and here we capital ##ise each now must point out that only a computer science is could have thought of that she ' ll to get this one from here to there you make a copy you or the an ##oder your original no baby is about four to six months over to know he added now go where they are now baggage they can figure it out so we just have to make sure that that ' s what we do so here is jean it ' s a ga ##dget and if it ' s a big thing like a matrix of ve ##cchi ##a collection of stuff is the staff or be or here somewhere on the on the freedom ali ##san ##de choi so all we need to do is to copy the handle into due and the hand of his the more if this was a material me two words if it ' s a victor it rewards and then we cut the connection to the first gate to the des ##truct ##or dom ##burg get to throw away the good stuff and problem solved and so the course of getting sam ##avia stuff out if you do it like this is we child ##er a memory as i amend and now you know longer have to worry about pointer ##s memory management she had pointer ##s nor this dot ##h this complete sober control of the life sid ##le ha ##be ##o of object now some of us have been doing this since the nine is but is only became systematic and guaranteed that it could be done in the un ##sh ##ea ##thes is the hand ##i ##work of guy caught how athenian that found out how to so were formal ##ized that so that ' s easily done now also i like when talk about evolution to point out that i have never claimed she plus protest ##ation language it never was just enough to dorian the language is never meant to be just enough to tor ##tel ##ius i don ' t think everything should be in class fires or any of the staff so shelton object ##or an i just object ##or in the for any definition of object ##ors for sara ' s we need to deal with this dire mapping the hard ware and hard were tends to be messiah to do things that the tube ##way like objects in a real way they actually real world objects and you you have col ##port ##er cure her curious somewhat per ##verse semantics an so del ##ep ##ier ##re we want mel ##oman ##iac ##s for some things so a be a becomes be means they had the same value and mort ##ification of the one doesn ' t fix the all this is what we do for encore ##s for complex numbers or point for the tor ##s et ce ##tera so that the less that model has always been in inc ##uba ##tion of the things we do also i want to say square with a true not two dusk ##ily think there ' s a nice is notation this a nice notation and such and i don ' t want to have two versions of the roof seeing she i if i add a floating point no button inside i don ' t want in the inter ##du ##ces to have something of ae ##to ##lian numbers in the throat in point number the class takes one thing at acting i want that the old fashioned light ##ener years old notation ##s that the ##t pro ##th ##oe ##nor programming was always part of her of the sea port grasp ##an so i let doesn ' t fit with the to ##ctor i think so these days the control of the pro ##tas ##is by an yo ##se ##mite and the way it happened was that representatives from h p and santa ##nta my office and explained to me that i wanted to stand thy separately so answered will ##iard ' s not finished it to a project in the hot twist in my arm to a or an indian as it yes the argument worse that you could not have a language can major language poor lit by her controlled by a simi ##le a company every body believed that those days it has been proven on true people using job and c sharp even though they are owned and operated by an individual or company that might be your competitive anyway at the time nobody believes that could be done they have not thought them of the advertising campaign se ##qu ##oia and the alla ##ient was ra ##bb ##lin well we will not trust your your employer eight an she we will of course trust you but you could get or no or by a bush in the book and so i agreed to send a i ##zation as many kinds of scandal ##ization i the irish os ##ten ##tation here is sort of the gold standard of den ##ization its terri ##ton and the haste rose and so we get let long terms severity which is a feature an important feature to many of the major uses its venom it ' s really hard to sort of courage she had patience to the favour ##s my company around us and such and the dangers designed by a committee is horrible and st ##ag ##nation could happen if if people are decided not to do major things because they couldn ' t agree on which made your things to do there is a virginia ##n of the sign if you get sufficient number of people a con ##can thing and they have a tendency of a wild abe ##rra ##ting any individual feature you can see that in separate places i ' m not going to go into detail i ' m just going to show you the picture of the committee ah so this is what it loop ##like than it became sad then became that and this was an earlier this year how can you get that group of pew ##ter of anything they come from i francois the free industries have different lass ##ies have gr ##ati ##fication this is really really heart and i o i reckon this is a picture of my major problem was she proposed it is amazing that we have succeeded as far as reduced but let ' s see i ' m going to talk li ##cent ##iate got from well about there till twenty years from now on to three years from now so there ' s evolution e ##ga ##de ##an ai ##leen first one was in ninety eight then fourteen and seventeen ah she prof ##essed was made or improvement this was what we had learned or the previous decade in a bit standards come every ten years we actually took thirteen which was one of the reasons with decided we can ' t see to in doing this so we decided we goo ##go ##o a three year side or and e ##ite ##l ##heimer what we had to deliver there ' s lots of meet ##ers me lev ##en lots of sim ##pl ##ification one of the ways are working is that there ' s a language with contracting away because of the ability how can you made simple to use the answers have been chose te ##tan ##us in the general ones and then have roads for how to use them well now people say why don ' t you just throw away the old stuff well half of the pictures i had in the first ul ##ie ##tea and people everybody wants to moran ##ges and by the way the language is too big you should make it more and don ' t break my cook these are the sort of the the heart con ##stra ##ins or on one vol ##ution and the we have taken you bus ##con in such now we have three mature in primitive implements of separate pang jesus and microsoft and by the way they shipped essentially or of she proposes seventeen this year and the standard hasn ' t been signed off in geneva yet the change his have done it in the taking a guys have delivered the compiler ##s lo ##ot ##ie using the more ready we are delivering on tide this is spectacular for the food i mean remember we deliver and time not as much as outline would be delivered so separate eleven ten years of experience long list you can do up tel ##esthesia has some see ##the references lots of places i am not going to go into details going through the slide any detail take a day for when i continue that and just going to show one example here of simple close ##n so here and going to say the old problem in a container see i want to find all the elements it has the very you be and what i ' m going to do is in going to return a point of each of those elements and let ' s see an example here we have a stray strange ##st contain a characters mary had a little lamb yet and so put each point of that comes out a fine door as we sit by giving it in and looking for the age i ' m going to see the point ore ##lli tone if it doesn ' t the something seriously wrong okay so i see not the words i want this to test well that was a that was made that was me and that was me the way we do it is re start a big car of pointer ##s cho elements miss case there you type of sees character cha ##l and for each in se seized the values right if it is pushed pointer to the lee end of the lee ##side and returned the victor now is this had been as she proposing eight program we would have had a serious performance bog there because men victor of four elements is not that expensive too to pass however i might have given it a mega ##bate ##s and return a million pointer ##s and even modern hardware can feel copying a million points however modern actors do not copy lame so ban ##ister she so the difference between she has pushed eleven and she brought out my tape ##r is what you don ' t see you don ' t see any point as you don ' t see any occasion should don ' t see any range cheeks it ' s all gone away it done implicit ##ly in places and is toni ##ello that ' s what different so per ##force we in ##ish ##een ##y the point here is that when you have a large project before the end of the project before the shipping day you have a future for ease and while i eye ##piece happens you learn things new con ##t do anything about it so far as tender ##est or freeze ##s about a year before you ship the standard after having a major i release you start using it and your line things you hadn ' t gifted you you you and so the idea is after three years we have had the feature freeze we have run what the effect of the eggs the features are and we can fix it in time before the next feature for each and that ' s how we got she propose fourteen it complete eleven and it all planned and it has lots of little things the these this here for instance lay graphical people really wanted by na ##rra ##te a constant show ##ain the binary constance the obe ##dian ##t it ' s a it ' s a bit paler then we found the people hungry tito ##ff and i see that is okay then we gave people did you separate us with your just pole ##man reading the coat were all interest in things to sim ##plify things by making bugs more or less likely and that what this does lots of things here a member were still maintaining comparatively yes well like to get rid of some of the old crowd but we can ' t we tried so are one of the thing to have been doing in the lay framework we have a lot of request for the name to do more at compiled time shall i lot ##op ##ha ##gi they have some cold and he needs a beau in there so they go to us to repair on the side and the calculated by the usually capable on the general on they put it into their coat then you wait a coroner ' s miss mal ##der ##ton valid and you have a magic constance i have bun ##some had request please from the embedded systems in testing for doing berth ##ings had combined time they also sometimes want to put constance into a run and a separate wasn ' t good enough for that act or think it was but they didn ' t agree so here is an example a somebody in the japanese and better into embedded systems industry wondered and entered just queer root function taking executed at might ##ily that we say let we want to have it so that it can be calculated a compiled time then you write the simplest outward and be confined this will be executed as camp ##iere compiled copies do this trick the function has to be pure in the sense that he cannot have side effects and it cannot operate on any date that is in its ac ##umen if somebody likes night man em ##etic ##al functions just just ##ly quietly a constable that takes care of that problem for a lo ##more i allows to com ##pile a square away the information necessary to do this and if it did it for every function you couldn ' t com ##pile really be programmed so it ' s important that we have to say it so we now take the square or of mine and take its quarter one to three four and we don ' t have those i use a due to patent we don ' t have to do strange things to nero to do it now she proposes to do the basic staff and then the handle abstraction ##s so let ' s see we can do can compare time abstraction ##s here ' s a little abstraction it ' s a week day of june the twenty first two thousand sixteen this is an example of the use of my favourite day li ##bra this is the cornice landed right thus we can do without a com ##pile him let ' s take a steady assert which is not set that is sure evaluated at com ##pie ##gne to see if it worked so i ' m saying that the big day of june the twenty first the two thousand sixteen i choose and it is so this assertion does not fire but if it if i ' d been wrong it would have i give me a com ##pile time or so we can actually do none trivial ##ities at com ##pie ##gne the way this library is a more efficient than anything else you ' ve done for dates so it ' s not he has not become elegant by being in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt so seventeen should have been a major re ##lish the idea was to pick up the interlude of pictorial major ease miners made their mess and see pro ##cr ##ast ##inate es ##so he had me com ##pan ##ero the standards comedian the slow rate of evolution of sea prop ##osi ##n the miniatures is what i mean this soap ##ing great it ' s only okay ah that is a a a little bit for everybody i think everybody will find something they like the proper miss of there are may be eighteen features and if you like two of them you tor ##min ##t have to understand the other the rest of them as a nice power of this library is a variety that useful some way a feeling with wa ##wat ##am return mess ##ures this is good this good but it ' s not great so let ' s see where the go from here and we need a guiding co ##osh for kind of this we can ' t just say is this feature good let ' s take it is this feature good now that ' s not take it what are the criteria what i the direction for where we are going so basin ##g aims include complete ivan resources as far op ##ac ##ity else good on one half were whenever man hardware is going to become a significant devi ##ser compilation even though we are doing that or checking i i don ' t think that ' s a modest ##y it is an basically the nod ##dles that i his love and the best as the enemy of good that since logan count just dream were gone to build champ ##ing its cone to be useful i want this to be useful in twenty twenty and i want the prototypes to be used able next year so i were going to do this that engineer right so make she fore ##pa ##ugh better too for building the morning at the cat ##ion that is the argument aim and these are the sort of more specific aims but challenges i i try to set a loco ##ed with the science so whip ##lash ##es no don ' t want philosophy it lot ##op ##ha ##gia ##ns also it is absolutely only way of mechanic ##ian and so have a cream ##ing this is absolutely essential and he is more a language is more than a collection of features and individual feature can be great and just be a distraction in the context of a type system and all the features we watch you better we must have a balance of features and basel ##y with a want to have me a habit and the sun ##lit mostly non check in on miss ##us were tack ##ed to get through to the gig ##i actually
